<p>We noticed that you're getting low on credits for your premium content so we thought we'd let you
know.</p>
<p>It is very important that you always have credits available for you users to be able to buy from you
otherwise you are going to run in to problems.</p>
<p>Top up now in the appy zone, your credits will be added instantly and you will have nothing to
worry about.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
